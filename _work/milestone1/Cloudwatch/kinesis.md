This is the result.. 

I like this - but I want the end to end working.. and I want to prove it in a real aws account.. For ex, here you created the records and inserted into DB directly..

I have an AWS account and I want to create real AWS kinesis streams.. 

And all the create delete analyze operations, I want to capture them in the integration tests.. No Mocking in any place and no short cuts.. In the past I am trying ti create the same, but you have 

1. mocked lot of code
2. Did not use correct AWS accounts or a hard coded AWS account
3. Created the resources using AWS cli 
4. Mocked the AWs reources and even added mock in the integration test..
5. Pass the test even if the auth failed

My goal is simple and clear.

1. I want the integration tests to call the backend to create the AWS kinesis Streams - in the correct account, correct region using correct profile - when I check in the AWS Console, i should see the resouces
2. The integration tests should handle the auth (admin, admin123) - generate tokens and use that cofrrectly - If the login fails, or, resoruce creation fails, or resrouce creation assertion fails, then double check the logic and make sure that works.
3. Analys the created resourcs using LLM - I understand local llm, deepseek, chatgpt integrations may not be available yet in the code, or mocked in code, or the implementaion is not 100% correct - our objective is to solve everything.

In another words,
After this implementation, i have a 1000% confident that the entire functionality is working as expected, and I can give to my friend and he can analyze his account without any hickups.

Analys the code, where we are deviatting and store the detailed course of actions in /Users/rajanpanneerselvam/work/mayyam-beta/_work/milestone1/Cloudwatch/sonnet.md
