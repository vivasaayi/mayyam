Critical Gaps Preventing Worldwide Adoption
1. User Experience Issues
Basic table interfaces vs. modern data grids (AG Grid, MUI DataGrid)
No status badges/indicators for pod health, resource usage
Missing loading states and error handling in UI
No responsive design for mobile/tablet access
2. Missing Core Features
No logs viewer - essential for troubleshooting
No metrics dashboard - resource monitoring
No YAML editor - advanced resource management
No real-time updates - WebSocket integration
Limited actions - restart, scale, exec into pods
3. Enterprise Features
No RBAC visualization - security management
No audit logging - compliance requirements
No backup/restore capabilities
No multi-tenancy support
4. Scalability & Performance
No performance benchmarks for large clusters
Limited concurrent user support
No caching layer for better performance
