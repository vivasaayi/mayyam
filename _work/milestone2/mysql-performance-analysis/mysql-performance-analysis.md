I want to select an MySQL Instanc and run various analysis on that instance using ChatGPT or DeepSeek or LocalLLm.

# Goals:
1. Should be a simple CLI, can be executable via an API
2. Assumes access to the MySql instance
3. Runs a predefined set of analysis on the instance
4. Outputs the results in a readable format
