üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Template
For each new resource type, you'll need:

Add to AwsResourceType enum
Create control plane module
Add sync method to main control plane
Update default resource types list
Add API endpoints and CLI commands
Would you like me to help you implement any of these specific AWS resources? I'd recommend starting with VPC resources or Security Groups as they're fundamental infrastructure components that most AWS environments have.
